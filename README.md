## Introduction

When Engineers or Technicians visit sites to provide technical services (such as repairs, troubleshooting, maintenance), a report should be filled by the visiting service provider and checked off by the service receiver to maintain accountability and transparency. The expectation of this project is to develop a simple, easy to use, robust software application for the above purpose.
